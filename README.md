# Bgtify

This is a small project that uses `img.ly` SDK for removing background.

I created this project because there are times when I need to remove image backgrounds quickly. And I don't want to use platforms like Photopea or have to install Photoshop just for this.

Images are not stored on any service, and you can verify this by looking the source code. Everything is processed directly by the browser.
